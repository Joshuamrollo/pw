        <p>
            I am currently pursuing a master's degree in computer science at the Georgia Institute of Technology. Previously, I worked on big data pipelines and attribution algorithms at Amazon Ads from 2022 and 2024 after completing my bachelor's degree in Management Information Systems at Baylor University.

            My hobbies come and go. Currently, I rock climb, play tennis, enjoy cooking(and eating), and follow professional tennis, bouldering and basketball. In the past I've enjoyed chess, table tennis, skiing, trumpet, video games, soccer, and probably a few other things.
